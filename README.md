a lightweight accountants tool to help assist in tax preparation, reconciliation and other reporting tasks.

I intend to take up this project just to practice the things i have learned through the self taught dev journey as i attempt to integrate it to developing productivity tools that act as swiss army knives for individuals in their day to day lives. Lets call it a minified ERP system with features built from scratch to help create an understanding of how things work and why they work when they work.
